# Are Clash Royale matchups rigged to counter your deck?

I don't think so. But some of my friends are unyielding Supercell-is-giving-me-hard-counters-after-I-win-too-much truthers.

Here, I employ a (soon-to-be) few quantitative approaches to see if there is any evidence of "counter-matchmaking" going on at scale.

Currently, I build a MatchupTable from top players' ranked games to compute pairwise winrates between each individual card in the game; effectively showing which cards 'counter' others based on winrate against each other.

This can then be used to compare against your own recent games if you suspect foul play in matchmaking!
